## 1. Emissions Regulations

### 1.1. Regulation (EU) 2024/1257 (Euro 7)

*   **Title:** Regulation (EU) 2024/1257 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 April 2024 on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines and of systems, components and separate technical units intended for such vehicles, with respect to their emissions and battery durability (Euro 7)
*   **Publication Date:** 2024-04-24
*   **Source:** [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2024/1257/oj/eng)
*   **Summary:**

The regulation sets out to limit emissions from vehicles, including particle number (PN) exhaust emissions. It encourages the use of state-of-the-art technology to achieve lower emissions and sets limits for various pollutants, including carbon monoxide (CO), total hydrocarbons (THC), non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and particle number (PN).

*   **Key Requirements:**
    *   **Emissions:** Stricter emission limits for vehicles, including particle number emissions down to 10 nanometres (PN10).
    *   **Battery Durability:** Minimum performance requirements for battery durability, including energy-based and range-based requirements, for vehicles of categories M1, N1, M2, M3, N2, and N3.
    *   **Non-Exhaust Emissions:** Measurement and limitation of non-exhaust emissions, such as particles from tyres and brakes.
    *   **Tampering Protection:** Prevention of tampering with pollution control systems and odometers, including security certificates and tampering protection.
    *   **Environmental Data:** Availability of an Environmental Vehicle Passport (EVP) for each vehicle, providing data on fuel consumption, emissions, and other relevant information.

### 1.2. Amendments to Euro 7 Emissions Standards

*   **Title:** Type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to their emissions and battery durability (Euro 7)
*   **Publication Date:** 2023-11-09
*   **Source:** [EUR-Lex](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/C/2024/2856/oj/eng)
*   **Summary:**

The European Parliament adopted amendments on the proposal for a regulation on type-approval of motor vehicles and engines with respect to their emissions and battery durability (Euro 7). The amendments aim to reduce pollution, promote clean mobility, and support the transition to zero-emission mobility. Key amendments include the introduction of new recitals emphasizing the importance of a toxic-free environment and the European Green Deal.

## 2. Sustainability Initiatives

### 2.1. Public Consultation on CO2 Emission Standards and Car Labelling

*   **Title:** Commission launches public consultation on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans and on car labelling
